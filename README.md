# Roslyn Cookbook
This is the code repository for [Roslyn Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/roslyn-cookbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787286832), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Open-sourcing the C# and Visual Basic compilers is one of the most appreciated things by the .NET community, especially as it exposes rich code analysis APIs to analyze and edit code. If you want to use Roslyn API to write powerful extensions and contribute to the C# developer tool chain, then this book is for you. Additionally, if you are just a .NET developer and want to use this rich Roslyn-based functionality in Visual Studio to improve the code quality and maintenance of your code base, then this book is also for you.
### Instructions and Navigations
All of the codes are organized as per the chapters, each folder has the codes related to that chapter or appendix.                   
For example: Roslyn-Cookbook/Chapter01/Recipe 1 - default analyzer/CSharpAnalyzers/CSharpAnalyzers/CSharpAnalyzers.Vsix/
